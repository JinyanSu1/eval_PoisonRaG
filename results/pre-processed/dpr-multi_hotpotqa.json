Since 2007, Nev has starred in his own CBBC show \"Bear Behaving Badly\", alongside Barney Harwood. His name was created from the name of his co-star Dev Griffin on Smile. He was last seen on Hacker Time when Derek puts Nev on Line 1 for Barney Harwood. Nev has patches in places on his body and is missing part of his ear. This is due to Bandit the cat, who is seen in some episodes of \"Bear Behaving Badly\", trying to eat him. Nev often has trouble with pronunciation of certain words, he cannot sing but he can rap well. Nev likes ice cream, jam, dressing up, sleeping in and his 'snuggly ducky duck duck'. When scared or intimidated, he growls, just like a real bear would. Originally on \"Smile\", the voice of Nev was prerecorded with his limited vocabulary played in as appropriate. When Nev took on a more significant role in \"Smile\", puppeteer Ross Mullan, who also stars in \"Bear Behaving Badly\", was recruited to provide the voice live. On December 28, 2007, Nev appeared on a puppet special of \"The Weakest Link\" hosted by Anne Robinson and broadcast on BBC One, but was eliminated in the fourth round of play, and as hinted in his post-elimination interview, he has a crush on both Soo and host Anne Robinson.

The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.

Soca was initially developed by Lord Shorty around 1972\/1973 in an effort to improve traditional calypso which seemed to be on its dying legs in Trinidad by the start of the 1970s with the rise in popularity of reggae from Jamaica and soul & funk from USA with the younger generation. A sound project was started in 1970 at KH Studios, Sea Lots in Trinidad, to find a way to record the complex calypso rhythm in a new multi-track era. Musicians involved in the initiative were Robin Imamshah (guitar, project lead), Angus Nunez (bass), Errol Wise (Drums), Vonrick Maynard (Drums), Clarence James (Percussion), Carl Henderson (Keyboards), David Boothman (strings). Some of the early songs recorded at the KH Studios that benefitted from this recording project are \u201cIndrani\u201d by Lord Shorty and \"Calypso Zest\" by Sensational Roots both recorded in 1972. Later came the soca hits \u201cEndless Vibrations\u201d and \u201cSweet Music\u201d by Lord Shorty recorded in 1974 and 1975 respectively and \u201cSecond Fiddle\u201d by Ella Andall recorded in 1975.

Inspired by material the group composed while performing around Europe, \"Wish You Were Here\" was recorded during numerous recording sessions at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Two of the album's four songs criticise the music business, another expresses alienation and the multi-part track \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" is a tribute to Syd Barrett. Barrett's mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier, prior to the release of the group's second studio album \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" (on which he only appeared on three tracks). It was lead writer Roger Waters' idea to split \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" into two parts that would bookend the album around three new compositions and to introduce a concept linking them all. The band had used a linking concept for their previous album, \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", to great success. As with \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", the band used studio effects and synthesizers and brought in guest singers to supply vocals on some tracks of the album.
