Developing from an experimental approach of never playing the same song twice, earlier material seemed to be influenced by everything from punk to funk to Ennio Morricone. Original members Mark (guitar) and drummer Phil Krauth were joined by Bridget Cross on bass in 1990 and their sound evolved into a minimalist but lively kind of pop. The two full-length albums released with this line up, 1992's \"Imperial f.f.r.r.\" and 1993's \"Perfect Teeth\" (distributed by the influential British label 4AD Records) featured finely crafted pop songs interspersed with strange avant-garde percussive and sonic tracks (sometimes featuring nothing but white noise, beeps or sirens). EPs released around the same time period reveal an even more pronounced gap between pop and experimental elements. The group broke up in 1994 with Phil pursuing a solo career and Mark and Bridget continued for a time as Air Miami, which released two singles and one album, \"me me me\".

The group consisted of Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. Dolenz and Jones had been members of 1960s pop group\/band The Monkees while Boyce and Hart had written many of the group's biggest hits such as \"Last Train to Clarksville\" and \"(Theme from) The Monkees\". As such, several publications, such as Allmusic, consider the album to be a Monkees-reunion album. Most of the musicians that appear on this album were featured on Monkees albums in the past. A majority of the vocals are done by Dolenz and Jones (\"Right Now\", \"I Remember The Feeling\", \"You And I\") with Boyce And Hart contributing backing vocals and the occasional lead vocal such as Hart's on \"I Love You [And I'm Glad That I Said It]\". Although the album failed to make much of an impact when originally released, renewal of interest in The Monkees led to its reissue on compact disc years later. The group was called Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart because they were legally prohibited from using The Monkees name.

Peter Tork joined 'Dolenz, Jones, Boyce, & Hart' onstage for a guest appearance on their concert tour on July 4, 1976 in Disneyland.

Shinnick was credited with beating Boston at that meet, but a wind reading was not taken on Shinnick's jump. So in effect, had the jump been officiated properly and the wind legal, Boston should have been beating Shinnick's mark. Boston had problems with the wind himself. He jumped 8.49\u00a0m\u00a0(27\u00a0ft\u00a0floor(((8.49)*3.28084)\u2212(floor((8.49)*3.28084)) *12)\u00a0in) to win the trials, but that jump was wind aided.

The race at the 1970 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships where he set the World Record of 1:07.6 in the event is regarded as the best indoor race and the number 7 track and field competition of the 20th Century.
